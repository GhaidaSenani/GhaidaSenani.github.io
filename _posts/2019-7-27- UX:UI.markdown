Being a part of the User experience and User interface unit training program for three weeks. It was an excellent opportunity full of creativity and inspiration. I leaned and gained new skills and concepts. Furthermore, I understood UX/UI concepts and processes. UX research method and empathy dimensions. Moreover, I created several personas, as shown below .

Personas are fictional or real characters that you create based on your research to present the different user types that might use your service. Also, creating a persona will help you to understand your users' needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals [1]. Subsequent, I sketched the user flows, "the path is taken by a prototypical user on a website or app to complete a task" [2], and wireframes" is a way to design a website or application service at the structural level" [3].

Subsequently, the interfaces were designed and prototyped, as shown below
